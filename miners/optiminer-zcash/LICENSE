Copyright (c) 2016 Optiminer.

You are allowed to run this program on any number of machines.

The miner uses a small amount of the GPU time to support the developer
(unless the --nodevfee option is used where it runs a bit slower). By using
this software you agree to support the developer in this way. You agree to not
take any actions to disable the fee (except using --nodevfee), to remove or
divert the fee mining time or to redirect the dev fee to a different account.

Modification or disassembling of the program is disallowed.

Distribution to 3rd parties is not permitted.
