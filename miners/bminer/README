Bminer: When Crypto-mining Made *Fast*
======================================

Bminer is a highly optimized Equihash miner that runs on modern NVIDIA GPUs (Maxwell and Pascal, i.e. GPUs that have compute capability 5.0 or above). Bminer is one of the *fastest* publicly available Equihash miners today -- we use various techniques including tiling and pipelining to realize the full potentials of the hardware.

Bminer also comes with REST APIs to facilitate production deployments (e.g., mining farms).

Similar to other miners, Bminer contains 2% devfee.

Quickstart
==========

To mine [Zcash](https://z.cash) on Windows on [nanopool](https://zec.nanopool.org/):

  * Download and extract Bminer into a folder (e.g. C:\bminer)
  * Edit mine.bat and change the address to the desired Zcash address that Bminer mines towards
  * Open command line prompt and run mine.bat.
  * Enjoy mining :-)
